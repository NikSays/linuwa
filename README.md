# README
**Linuwa** probably is the first conlang published on github  
It all started with "what if we did our language?"  
We are making linuwa full of concepts, that are common to most of languages.
But then... we throw in a bunch of crazy stuff
## Short info
* 12 phonemes, 2 used interchangeably. But syllables can contain up to 5 vowels.
* 4 Parts of speech, adjectives and adverbs are one thing (it depends only on word they are describing). 
* Only 2 tenses ~~(English I'm looking at you)~~
* 2 cases, but subject of an intransitive verb may be treated like object
	>	I swim - voluntary action. Swims me - involuntary (Water carries me away)
*  Word agreement is not necessary, word order makes it for you
