# Verb-like property

Combines verb and property

Used when you need to describe something with an verb, therefore with another sentence

So this is basically a subordinate clause marker

`nejo lomoawo mono - The hearing cat is walking` 

### Separate verb-like properties' dependent words with "and"

`nejo lomojowa loilamo - Beautifuly reading cat`  
`nejo lomojowa lu loilamo - Beautiful and reading cat`
