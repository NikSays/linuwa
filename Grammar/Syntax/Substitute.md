# Substitute clause

ro - substitute clause marker, can be inflected. You can think about it, as a word combining the whole substitute clause in itself.

In `nau namoolane lijoo joro reu meawo` ro is making the whole sentence after it an adjective by using jo. So it translates `I know the thing you heard`
