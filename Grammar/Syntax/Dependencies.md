# Dependencies
* Dependent words never agree with main ones

  `nau moolora linejo loilamo (not liloilamo) - I love beautiful cat`

* Separate dependents of 2+ main words with and

  `nejo lomojowa loilamo - Beautifuly reading cat`  
  `nejo lomojowa lu loilamo - Beautiful and reading cat`

## Dependent clause
ro - subordinate clause marker, can be inflected. You can think about it, as a word combining the whole dependent clause in itself.
In `nau namoolane lijoo loro reu meawo` `ro` is making the whole sentence after it an adjective by using `lo`. So it translates 'I know the thing you heard'
